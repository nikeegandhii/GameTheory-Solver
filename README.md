# GameTheory-Solver
 This is a Game Theory solver written in Python, which computes both the Nash Equilibrium and Mixed Strategy of a game set by the user.
 The program allows the user to input the Game details, by first asking to input the Players and then the different possible Decisions they can do.
 Ultimately, the user has to input the Matrix of the Game, which can be done by inserting two numbers for each cell.
